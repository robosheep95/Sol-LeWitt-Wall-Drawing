# Sol LeWitt â€“ Wall Drawing

American artist Sol LeWitt created an art piece represented through a set of instructions. This art piece consists of random elements and therefor allows for infinite renditions.

I would like to create an online demonstration of this art piece. I will use and improve my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP or .NET, SQL, Data Modeling and Development practices.

This project will consist of the following goals
- Create a graphically clean demonstration of the LeWitt Wall Drawing
-	Create a canvas to allow a user to create their own LeWitt Wall Drawing
-	Create a database for users to store their created drawings
-	Extra: Inform users if they have created a unique drawing or if someone else had made it and when.
